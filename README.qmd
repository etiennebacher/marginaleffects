The `marginaleffects` package for `R` and `Python` offers a single point of entry to easily interpret the results of [over 100 classes of models,](https://marginaleffects.com/vignettes/supported_models.html) using a simple and consistent user interface. Its benefits include:

- *Powerful:* It can compute and plot predictions; comparisons (contrasts, risk ratios, etc.); slopes; and conduct hypothesis and equivalence tests for over 100 different classes of models in `R`.
- *Simple:* All functions share a simple and unified interface.
- *Documented*: Each function is thoroughly documented with abundant examples. The Marginal Effects Zoo website includes 20,000+ words of vignettes and case studies.
- *Efficient:* [Some operations](https://marginaleffects.com/vignettes/performance.html) can be up to 1000 times faster and use 30 times less memory than with the `margins` package.  
- *Valid:* When possible, [numerical results are checked](https://marginaleffects.com/vignettes/supported_models.html) against alternative software like `Stata` or other `R` packages.
- *Thin:* The `R` package requires relatively few dependencies.
- *Standards-compliant:* `marginaleffects` follows "tidy" principles and returns simple data frames that work with all standard `R` functions. The outputs are easy to program with and feed to other packages like [`ggplot2`](https://marginaleffects.com/vignettes/plot.html) or [`modelsummary`.](https://marginaleffects.com/vignettes/tables.html)
- *Extensible:* Adding support for new models is very easy, often requiring less than 10 lines of new code. Please submit [feature requests on Github.](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/marginaleffects/issues)
- *Active development*: Bugs are fixed promptly.
